# 5min DnD

Pretty simple game. Idea is to come up with random stories and flex the imagination muscles.
Each person gets a turn to add a sentence or so (140 chars) to the story and play moves on to the next person.
Each turn will have a random image that the player must somehow weave into their story.

## How do I try it out?

Open the site up and you'll be presented with lobbies and the option to create a new lobby. Do either and wait until you have a full lobby. Once the lobby is full, anyone can start it (bug or feature you tell me)
Extra players will become spectators, having only the side chat available to them. The story chat can only be written to by the current player's turn.
Play doesn't really end currently and keeps going indefinitely instead.

That's pretty much it

Thanks to Rory's story cubes for giving me the idea of it.
They're also the images I am using currently but they can be swapped out at any time I find a new set of suitable sprites.

## Reasoning

This was a mini hackathon for me. I limited myself to 4 days to get the idea up and running and by the end of the 3rd day, most of the functionality was done. The 4th day I did nothing, followed by another day of nothing. The day after, I actually decided to finish up the css a bit. So while it wasn't 4 consecutive days, close enough for me. I was deadset on trying out material ui and doing something with sockets and this is what I came up with.
